# Fake-News-Prediction-Using-BERT

This repository contains a Python notebook for classifying news as real or fake.

Project Highlights:

Dataset: WELFake Dataset (72,000+ articles)

EDA: Includes analysis of article text/title length and label distribution.

Model 1 (Scikit-learn): LogisticRegression with TfidfVectorizer.

Model 2 (Deep Learning): A neural network built with PyTorch.

Goal: Compare the accuracy and F1-score of a traditional ML approach vs. a deep learning approach for fake news detection.
